# A Use-Case-and-Semantics-Based Approach to Identifying Microservices in Legacy Monolithic Web Applications

## Overview 

## Subject web applications 
### [JPetStore2](https://github.com/KimJongSung/jPetStore)

It is a full web application in the form of a pet store, showcasing the structure of an e-commerce platform, built on Spring 3 and MyBatis 2.

### [JPetStore6](https://github.com/mybatis/jpetstore-6)

Another version of JPetStore built using MyBatis 3, Spring 5, and Stripes.


### [PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)

PetClinic is a sample application by SpringSource for the Spring Framework, designed to manage pet and veterinarian information, with both original and Thymeleaf-enabled versions.

### [ShoppingApp](https://github.com/manhduydl/Shopping-web-Jsp-Servlet)

ShoppingApp is a full web application built with Servlet and JSP, without using AJAX.

### [DayTrader](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.daytrader7)

DayTrader 7 is a sample application for an online stock trading system based on Java EE 7. DayTrader leverages key Java EE 7 technologies, including JSP, Servlets, EJB, JPA, JDBC, JSF, CDI, Bean Validation, JSON, JMS

## Project structure 

### Ground truths 
The ground truth is generated by an expert in web applications who analyzes open-source web apps. The expert utilizes both static and dynamic data to classify components into microservices in order to generate the ground truth.

### Baselines 
This package includes the microservice identification results of the four baseline methods that were compared with our approach. Each method provides microservice identification results for all five open source web applications.

### Model 
This folder contains the models used in our approach for identifying microservices. Each model reflects specific information about the web application.
- ### Behavioral 
  The behavior model represents the execution status of components for each use case. The execution status is represented by a value of either 0 or 1.
- ### Semantic 
  This model is a collection of embedding results for each component, generated using Word2Vec based on their names.
- ### Hybrid
  The Hybrid model, which combines the Behavioral model and the Semantic model, is the final model used in our approach.

### Results
This folder includes the results used in the Evaluation section.
